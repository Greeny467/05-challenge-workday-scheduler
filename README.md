## What is this?
This is a website designed to act as a workday scheduler. It has a list of hour elements, which you can enter your appointments or plans into. To create this, I was given the base website with three hour slots and the basic title and page elements. I added the majority of the hour slots and created the functionality of the save button, which saves the text you put within the hour slots as local storage, so that when you reload the page the same text reappears. I gave the website has a color coding system, which colors past hours as grey, present as red, and future as green. Beyond this, the website also features a clock of sorts, presenting the current time and date, which updates every 30 seconds.
